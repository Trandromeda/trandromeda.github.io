Some elements in life benefit from a good dose of spontaneity, such as weekend roadtrips, ordering at a restaurant, or choosing which book to borrow from the library. Not so much with building an app from the ground up.

Without having a high-level overview of what you're trying to create, your app bears the risk of living perpetually in development limbo - that state of being where you have a lot of ideas, but nothing to show for it. It's not until you begin writing, drafting and firing up localhost:3000 that you can start to see your eventual masterpiece beginning to take form. And this is very important, because once your idea travels from the realm of imagination into reality, you'll actually *have* something to put your effort towards, and you can start to see which of your ideas are going to work out or not.
