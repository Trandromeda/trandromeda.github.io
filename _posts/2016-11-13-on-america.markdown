It's been 5 days since the USA elected its new President, and the election is still on everyone's minds. I was one of the many people who were baffled by the results - it just didn't seem possible that people could put their faith behind a man so unprofessional, so petty and so crude.

I've been trying to understand how this happened. Newscasters and journalists are now looking back and saying how obvious the outcome was, as if they weren't fooled either. The most common things you'll hear about are the angry voters, poor turnout from milllennials and minorities, and people voting against Clinton rather than for Trump.

I think this issue goes further back than that, and sheds some light on how America is both 'the land of freedom and opportunity' and 'the land of racism and greed.'

First off, many people were unhappy about Obama's time in government. These Americans saw his policies and decisions as eroding American values and making life harder for them, while opening America's borders to all sorts of unsavoury types. These people also believe America is the greatest country in the world, and does everything the best and that nothing can be learned from anyone else. Meanwhile, many wealthy and developed nations have already adopted the things these Americans are raising a big stink over and are doing quite well with them, like universal health care.

I dug a little deeper into why Americans are so against Obamacare. The principles behind Obamacare are just not principles Americans are used to. Universal health care requires a nation of people to agree to make small, individual sacrifices for the betterment of all. In the States, however, the mentality is more of 'survival of the fittest' - very individualistic thinking - you make your own success, and if you fall on hard times, well, you're shit out of luck. It sounds very selfish, doesn't it? So, many Americans have instead taken to calling it freedom, which is much more marketable. When you shove 'freedom' down people's throats day in and out, they begin to believe it too with all their heart.

I don't know if this is the vision of America the Founding Fathers had when they came together to sign those historic texts, but somewhere along the way something *must* have gotten lost in translation to result in this circus of a nation we witness today. America has certainly given the world some amazing thinkers, writers, inventors and scientists because it is a free country that encourages entrepreneurship and individual thinking, but the prejudiced mind can also take those things and twist them into hatefulness (disguised as patriotism) and bigotry (fear).

What we now have in 2016 is an extremely divided country - one that is so used to a certain way of living and treating other people, the very fabric of the nation threatens to tear apart at the faintest mention of change (the 'change' that many Trump supporters seem to espouse is changing back to an older, more conservative and close-minded way of life). They have known no other path but have had decades of exposure from every outlet telling them that America is the greatest country in the world. It is such a strange place where people are so impassioned about their country, they love it so much and want to protect it, yet they are so callous and indifferent to their fellow man and woman.

I'm so fucking glad my parents moved to Canada.
