About time for the first project update in this blog. We're getting close to laying down all the barebone essentials of the app - it's really not that complicated. The premise of it is fairly simple, but it will be the fine tuning and detailing that will be a challenge.

So this side project that I'm coding is a geolocation-based mobile web app that uses crowd-sourced data to show you freebies in your area. The idea for it actually came from my partner, who is big into bargains and free shit (he managed to fly to Asia for $150). We've just recently come up for a name - Gratis! The exclamation point is part of it.

The stack I'm using is React on top of Meteor, which works pretty well with each other. I'm learning both technologies as I'm going. Again, the basics are easy to grasp, but I anticipate it'll be the finer things like security, optimization and so on that will have me posting questions on Stack Overflow. 

I like working with React. Breaking things down into components, building hierachies, mapping out relationships and data flows - it's a fun creative process. Compared to Angular, which I've been using exclusively for our front-end development at work, React has been quicker to pick up and filled with fewer obscure terminology. Getting accustomed to React's syntax at the same time as ES6 was a bit tricky at first, but now I can mentally switch between Angular and React seamlessly.

Meteor has been enjoyable to use as well but I've barely scratched the surface of it. Still getting used to just knowing *where* to put my code. I want to do everything right from the beginning so there's less band-aid applying later down the road. I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to set up a Collection in my database, and how open-ended it is.

For the app's aesthetic, we're going with Material Design. It'll keep things clutter-free and modern (for 2016). Though the only noticeable design elements will be the header, some buttons, and a list.

So right now, the app is able to load a map with your current location, and then you can add a new Freebie item via a modal that will create a marker where you are, that will display information about the giveaway or deal. The Freebies will auto-expire after a set amount of time. Lots of other neat stretch goals planned in the future.

Nowadays I try to put in at least one hour a day into the app, so I'll try to have another update in about 6 weeks time, with more substantial learnings hopefully!
