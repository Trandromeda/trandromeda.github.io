Back to posting in this blog after a long hiatus! There were a few significant changes in my life that took up all my time, as well as a two-week trip around Asia. But the flagship Hacking Health Hackathon is next month, which is what I want to write about today.

I’ve been with Hacking Health for close to three years now, and they have been a pivotal part of my career transition from health policy to health tech. The first time I volunteered in the planning of the hackathon, it was in Vancouver and I didn't even know how to write a line of code.

My primary responsbility was finding and securing mentors who could come and guide hackathon participants through their prototyping journey, including tech experts, designers, business consultants, and the like. It was a fantastic way to learn about all the awesome and different things people are doing in the eHealth space. The main ways I found mentors were through word-of-mouth, faculty directories, startups, agencies, and consultancies. It was quite a lot, and today the list of people who’d qualify as experts in this industry would be even larger.

This year we’ve changed things a bit. For one, we try to organize monthly meet-ups leading up to the big event, each focusing on topics that would benefit hackathon goers like design thinking and ideation, physician-led innovation, and government policy and funding. In fact, my office will be hosting one next week that’s looking at how to think like a dev or designer when you’re at the hackathon itself.

We've also partnered with the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) and the projects will be centered around nine grant winners (researchers). It is very exciting, because for the first time ever there is the possibility that every single team will walk away from this hackathon with a working, functioning demo, as well as the funding and investment to turn all of these ideas into real solutions. Even I've signed up to join one of the teams (don't worry, the judging is done by a totally separate entity so my involvement in Hacking Health will have no impact at all).

The people who work to make Hacking Health happen are very important. We’re all volunteers, and the only thing that keeps us doing this is because we want to. We don’t need the hours, we all have jobs and personal lives, and there’s nothing keeping us from dropping it and moving on. I always find that remarkable. At the same time, coordinating things like meetings or phone calls can be a little tricky because we don’t have that hard obligation and we tend to be busy bodies.

For any big event like this, marketing is critical and that’s when the people behind the scenes come in again. We rarely do ‘cold calls’ and prefer to reach out to our own networks to find and recruit people. The team is diverse enough that we’re able to hit multiple industries, though from what I’ve seen I  believe the head of Hacking Health Toronto knows every single health tech person in the city. Another great thing about the tech and startup sector is that it’s small enough that word-of-mouth often carries a message like wildfire.

I like being with Hacking Health. When I started, HH was only in its second year and the idea of it was still quite novel. In 2017, there are a lot of health startups sprouting up and even a few other hackathons that are health focused. Yet HH has always felt like the ‘renegade’ - we’re not backed by big money, the people on the teams are colourful, quirky and enthusiastic, and no matter who we work with we always take a grassroots approach. For as long as I’m in Toronto (or any city with a HH chapter), they will continue to be a part of my life.
