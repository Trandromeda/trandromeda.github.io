The most rewarding part of my job as a coding bootcamp TA is helping ordinary people who've never seen a line of code before understand things like *loops*, *classes* or *ORMs*.

Maybe it's because I was also a bootcamp grad, but I lean towards very descriptive, visual and elementary explanations when it comes to breaking down programming concepts. For instance, my favourite way to help people understand the use of tux in Sinatra is by comparing it to a sandbox. Each time tux is loaded, you get a fresh slate to play around with. Writing raw SQL queries to the database is too taxing, so you have models that help you manipulate your data. When you want to interact with the table in the database, you want to use your model name with a capital. Lower case names are for defining local variables that only exist in that instance of tux and can be named whatever you want.

"Boxes" are also featured prominently in code: a class is defined inside a box, functions are inside boxes, files live in boxes. The idea of a beginning of a method and the end of a method is not intuitive to everyone, and everybody makes silly typos. Even the vets.

I always see students stumble when it comes to understanding the difference between working with User and user in the console, and each cohort there's a handful of people who get confused when they close tux and then their variables are no longer there when they open it again. Some students benefit from a very basic sticks-and-stones explanation when it comes to code, while others who have grasped the fundamentals only need to have a few misconceptions cleared way for them. It is almost always the former group that's more challenging to teach, because many of the ideas you've now taken for granted must be re-visited and dissected in a human language-friendly way.

The reason I took up coding was to make things and solve problems. Thus, I don't have a deep understanding of behind-the-scenes going-ons like performance, optimization, or very comp sci-focused details. I remember asking a simple question once about ES6 for Javascript and two senior devs/TAs broke out into a lengthy and esoteric discussion about it. No, that's not me and I don't have an interest in pursuing this field of study further than what I need. I'd rather see how technology can fit into bigger societal problems. Understanding programming principles also reinforces a way of thinking that can be applicable to myriad other areas in life. Such as being able to expertly google the answer to virtually any problem you might encounter.
