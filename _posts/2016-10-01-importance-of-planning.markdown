Some elements in life benefit from a good dose of spontaneity, such as weekend roadtrips, ordering at a restaurant, or choosing which book to borrow from the library. Not so much with building an app from the ground up.

Without having a high-level overview of what you're trying to create, your app carries the risk of living perpetually in development limbo - that state of being where you have a lot of ideas, but... that's it, they just stay as ideas. It's not until you begin writing, drafting and firing up localhost:3000 that you can start to see your eventual masterpiece beginning to take form. And this is very important, because once your idea travels from the realm of imagination into reality, you'll actually *have* something to put your effort towards, and you can start to see which of your ideas are going to work out or not.

I like to plan things out the old-fashioned way, with a pencil, 6 coloured pens, and notebook. The notebook is great for scribbling your thoughts, sketching, and making lists. I think that things also tend to stick better in your mind when you take the time to pen them out, rather than typing them into an app that's going to be buried beneath a mountain of other apps. The biggest benefit of a notebook that I see is that it's there in physical form.

In addition to the notebook, I like to organize my tasks on Trello. To be honest, I haven't looked into what other tools are available on the marketplace, but Trello works for me and I haven't felt the need to switch (contrary to what front end development feels like in 2016). I make a to do list, itemized by User Stories, and in the case of the app I'm working on I divide completed tasks into Back End and Front End. As I complete each item, I make notes in that item's card on what I did and what I learned. The Trello board is also shared with the designer. What I really like about Trello is that it doesn't throw 100 different options at you - just a few, very flexible options that allow you to organize your tasks in a vast array of ways.

And that's it. Notebook and Trello. I don't see the point in complicating things for the sake of appearing complicated and sophisticated. If it looks good and it gets the job done, then that's all you need. That's also my philosophy on app design, but more on that later!
